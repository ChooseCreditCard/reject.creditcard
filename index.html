          A decline is not the end of the story. It’s a signal from the issuer’s risk models that your profile
          doesn’t fit this specific card <em>right now</em>. This page explains why that happens and what to fix
          before trying again.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Declined ≠ “Never eligible”</h2>
      <p>
        When a credit card application is rejected, it usually means the issuer’s automated decision engine
        thinks the risk is too high or the fit is wrong <strong>at this moment</strong>, based on the information
        they see. It does <strong>not</strong> mean you will always be declined for all cards in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each bank has different policies, target customers and tolerance for risk. A rejection from one issuer
        may coexist with an approval from another – or an approval for a different type of card later on when
        your profile has changed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reasons -->
    <section id="reasons" class="section">
      <h2>Common Reasons Credit Card Applications Are Rejected</h2>
      <p>
        Decline letters or emails often include one or more generic reasons. Behind those phrases are typical
        patterns in your file:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>“Too many recent inquiries”</strong> – you’ve applied for several credit products within a
          short period, which can signal higher risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“High utilization”</strong> – you are already using a large share of your existing limits,
          suggesting limited spare capacity to take on more credit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Insufficient credit history”</strong> – your file is thin or very recent, so the issuer
          cannot reliably model your behaviour.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Delinquency or negative marks”</strong> – late payments, collections or defaults still
          showing on your report.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Income or affordability”</strong> – based on your declared income and obligations, the bank
          does not think the card fits their lending criteria.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The list in the letter is usually <strong>not exhaustive</strong>. It shows the main reasons, but several
        factors together may push the decision below the issuer’s internal cutoff.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Impact -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How a Rejection Affects Your Credit Profile</h2>
      <p>
        In most systems, the rejection itself is <strong>not</strong> recorded – what appears on your credit file
        is the <strong>hard inquiry</strong> from when you applied. A single inquiry has small impact, but many
        clustered inquiries can temporarily pull your score down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, repeatedly applying for multiple cards after being rejected can create a loop of:
        lower score → more declines → more inquiries. Breaking that loop usually means pausing applications
        and working on the underlying factors instead.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Next steps -->
    <section id="nextsteps" class="section">
      <h2>Practical Steps After a Rejection</h2>
      <p>
        Useful actions after receiving a decline decision typically include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reading the reason codes in the letter or email <strong>carefully</strong>.</li>
        <li>Checking your credit report with at least one bureau to confirm the data is accurate.</li>
        <li>Reducing utilization by paying down balances where possible.</li>
        <li>Letting some time pass without new applications to reduce the “many recent inquiries” flag.</li>
        <li>Using existing accounts responsibly to build a more stable history.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In some regions, you may have the right to ask for more detail about the decision or dispute incorrect
        information on your report. The process depends entirely on local law and bureau rules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- When to try again -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When (and How) to Apply Again</h2>
      <p>
        There is no universal waiting time, but many people choose to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wait several months before the next application, especially after multiple declines.</li>
        <li>Target cards designed for their current profile (for example, starter or rebuild products).</li>
        <li>Avoid applying for several cards in quick succession just “to see what happens”.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A better approach is to <strong>decide on a plan</strong>: improve utilization and history, then apply
        for one card that matches your situation instead of many random options.
